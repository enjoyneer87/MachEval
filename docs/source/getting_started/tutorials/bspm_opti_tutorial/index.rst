Background
-----------------------------------

The ``mach_opt`` module of ``eMach`` provides classes to interface with the ``Python`` optimization package ``Pygmo``. This module has been 
designed considering the optimization workflow provided below. In this tutorial, we will go over how users can develop their own classes to
follow this workflow and leverage ``mach_opt`` for optimization by going through an example of multi-physics BSPM optimization using ``eMach``.

Step 1: Create BSPM ``Designer``
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Nearly all population-based optimization workflows function by creating a set of ``Free Variables``, and thereafter, evaluating the resulting
fitness corresponding to these variables. There are a number of steps involved in this process. Creating a ``Design`` from the set of
``Free Variables`` is the first step. The class that performs this function is called the ``Designer`` in ``eMach`` terminology. 

To create a ``Designer``, we must first define the input ``Free Variables`` and the desired output ``Design``. In this tutorial, 

* **Input** ``Free Variables``: we are using a set of 11 variables that define the rotor and stator geometry. These ``Free Variables`` are :math:`\delta_e`, :math:`r_{ro}`, :math:`\alpha_{st}`, :math:`d_{so}`, :math:`w_{st}`, :math:`d_{st}`, :math:`d_{sy}`, :math:`\alpha_m`, :math:`d_m`, :math:`d_{mp}`, and :math:`d_{ri}` dimensions. Readers can refer to the :doc:`BSPM machine <../../../machines/bspm/bspm_machine>` document to understand the physical dimensions corresponding to these ``Free Variables``. 
* **Output** ``Design``: a BSPM design object which consists of a :doc:`BSPM Machine <../../../machines/bspm/bspm_machine>` and its corresponding :doc:`operating point <../../../machines/bspm/bspm_oper_pt>`. The BSPM ``Designer`` has an ``Architect`` to create the ``BSPM_Machine`` from ``Free Variables`` and a ``Settings_Handler`` to create the ``BSPM_Machine_Oper_Pt`` object. In this tutorial, the operating point is independent of the ``Free Variables``. As a result, the ``Settings_Handler`` always returns the same ``BSPM_Machine_Oper_Pt`` object. 

To create the BSPM ``Designer``, copy the ``bspm_architect.py``, ``bspm_settings_handler.py``, and ``bspm_designer.py`` files from the
``examples/mach_opt_examples/bspm_opt`` folder to your root directory. Update the import statements found at the top of each module as shown 
below to ensure the code works with the files in the new location.

For ``bspm_architect.py``:

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np

    from eMach.mach_eval.machines.bspm import BSPM_Machine
    from eMach.mach_eval.machines.bspm.winding_layout import WindingLayout

For ``bspm_settings_handler.py``:

.. code-block:: python

    from eMach.mach_eval.machines.bspm.bspm_oper_pt import BSPM_Machine_Oper_Pt

For ``bspm_designer.py``:

.. code-block:: python

    from bspm_architect import BSPM_Architect1
    from eMach.mach_eval.machines.bspm.bspm_specification import BSPMMachineSpec
    from eMach.mach_eval.machines.materials.electric_steels import Arnon5
    from eMach.mach_eval.machines.materials.jmag_library_magnets import N40H
    from eMach.mach_eval.machines.materials.miscellaneous_materials import (
        CarbonFiber,
        Steel,
        Copper,
        Hub,
        Air,
    )
    from bspm_settings_handler import BSPM_Settings_Handler
    from eMach.mach_eval import MachineDesigner

Step 2: Create BSPM Design ``Evaluator``
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Simply use the multi-physics BSPM design ``Evaluator`` developed in the :doc:`BSPM Evaluation Tutorial <../bspm_eval_tutorial/index>` in this 
step. Structural, electromagnetic, and thermal performance of BSPM designs will be analyzed using this ``Evaluator``. The coil temperature
limit set in Step 2.4 of :doc:`BSPM Evaluation Tutorial <../bspm_eval_tutorial/index>` can be reduced from :math:`300^\circ \, \rm C` to :math:`150^\circ \, \rm C` to optimize for a more realistic BSPM design.

Step 3: Create BSPM Optimization Design Space
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Finally, before running the optimization, the number of optimization objectives, the objectives themselves, and the bounds for the ``Free 
Variables`` must be decided upon. This information is held within the ``BSPMDesignSpace`` object. 

The optimization is run considering three objectives. This includes minimizing the weighted sum of torque and force ripple, and maximizing efficiency, power density. The class is configured such that the bounds are passed in as an argument during instantiation to provide users with the freedom of setting the bounds 
within the actual optimization script. 

To create the ``BSPMDesignSpace`` class, copy the ``bspm_ds.py`` file from the ``examples/mach_opt_examples/bspm_opt`` folder. The file can be used as-is.

Step 4: Update ``mach_opt`` ``DataHandler`` (if required)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

During optimization, a huge dataset of BSPM designs and information related to their performance is created. It is important to save this data
as the optimization runs so that one can resume the optimization in case it terminates prematurely due to unforseen errors. This data is also useful for post-processing after an optimization is complete. 

The base ``DataHandler`` provided within ``mach_opt`` implements the basic functionalities for optimization data handling, including saving and loading data using ``Pickle`` and extracting Pareto optimal designs. Depending on the optimization, one may need to add additional functionality, especially for
selecting candidate designs for further investigation. This can be achieved by inheriting the ``mach_opt`` ``DataHandler`` class and adding 
the methods required for candidate design selection and extraction. 

The ``my_data_handler.py`` file in ``examples/mach_opt_examples/bspm_opt`` folder provides an example implementation of a custom ``DataHandler`` class. Copy this file to your working directory and update the import statement as shown below.

.. code-block:: python

    import eMach.mach_opt as mo

Step 5: Run Optimization
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Finally, the multi-objective, multi-physics optimization can be run by combining the modules created up to this step. 

The code snippet provided below shows how to run this optimization. This code should be saved to a new Python file named ``bspm_optimization.py``. 

An important consideration while running the optimization is the bounds for the ``Free Variables``. This can be set by considering an analytically designed
machine as the baseline for an existing machine and applying scaling factors on its dimensions to get the bounds. 

Run ``bspm_optimization.py``. The optimization should run for as many generations as required to obtain the Pareto Front. If the optimization terminates before this is achieved due to unexpected errors, simply run the script again and the optimziation will resume from the last saved generation (based on ``latest_pop.csv``). 

.. code-block:: python

    import os
    from bspm_designer import designer
    from bspm_evaluator import bspm_evaluator
    from bspm_ds import BSPMDesignSpace
    from eMach.mach_opt import DesignProblem, DesignOptimizationMOEAD
    from my_data_handler import MyDataHandler

    # set bounds for pygmo optimization problem
    dims = (
        0.003,
        0.012,
        45,
        5.5e-3,
        9e-3,
        17e-3,
        13.5e-3,
        180.0,
        3e-3,
        1e-3,
        3e-3,
    )

    bounds = [
        [0.5 * dims[0], 2 * dims[0]],  # delta_e
        [0.5 * dims[1], 2 * dims[1]],  # r_ro    this will change the tip speed
        [0.2 * dims[2], 1.1 * dims[2]],  # alpha_st
        [0.2 * dims[3], 2 * dims[3]],  # d_so
        [0.2 * dims[4], 3 * dims[4]],  # w_st
        [0.5 * dims[5], 2 * dims[5]],  # d_st
        [0.5 * dims[6], 2 * dims[6]],  # d_sy
        [0.99 * dims[7], 1 * dims[7]],  # alpha_m
        [0.2 * dims[8], 2 * dims[8]],  # d_m
        [0 * dims[9], 1 * dims[9]],  # d_mp
        [0.3 * dims[10], 2 * dims[10]],  # d_ri
    ]

    # create optimization Design Space object
    opt_settings = BSPMDesignSpace(3, bounds)

    # create optimization Data Handler
    path = os.path.dirname(__file__)
    arch_file = path + r"\opti_arch.pkl"  # specify file where archive data will reside
    des_file = path + r"\opti_designer.pkl"
    pop_file = path + r"\latest_pop.csv"  # csv file holding free variables of latest population
    dh = MyDataHandler(arch_file, des_file)  # initialize data handler with required file paths

    # create pygmo Problem
    design_prob = DesignProblem(designer, bspm_evaluator, opt_settings, dh)
    # defin pygmo MOEAD optimization
    design_opt = DesignOptimizationMOEAD(design_prob)

    # define population size and number of generations
    pop_size = 78
    gen_size = 20

    # load latest population
    population = design_opt.load_pop(filepath=pop_file, pop_size=78)
    # create random initial population if no prior data exists
    if population is None:
        print("NO EXISTING POPULATION TO LOAD")
        population = design_opt.initial_pop(pop_size)

    # RUN OPTIMIZATION
    pop = design_opt.run_optimization(population, gen_size, pop_file)



Step 6: Optimization Post-Processing
--------------------------------------------------------------------
	
To fully leverage optimization, users must be able to effectively analyze the resulting data. This includes extracting the Pareto front,
evaluating trends in the ``Free Variables``, and selecting candidate designs. 

Copy the ``my_plotting_functions.py`` file from the ``examples/mach_opt_examples/bspm_opt`` folder to get the custom functions created for plotting the Pareto front and ``Free Variables`` of this optimization. 

Create a file named ``plot_script.py``. Copy and paste the code provided below to plot the Pareto front. As this optimization has three objectives, the marker color is used to indicate the value of the third objective, weighted ripple.

.. code-block:: python

    import os

    from my_data_handler import MyDataHandler
    from my_plotting_functions import DataAnalyzer

    path = os.path.dirname(__file__)
    arch_file = path + r'/opti_arch.pkl'  # specify path where saved data will reside
    des_file = path + r'/opti_designer.pkl'
    dh = MyDataHandler(arch_file, des_file)  # initialize data handler with required file paths

    fitness, free_vars = dh.get_pareto_fitness_freevars()

    da = DataAnalyzer(path)
    da.plot_pareto_front(points=fitness, label=['-SP [kW/kg]', '-$\eta$ [%]', 'WR [1]'])

An example Pareto plot obtained from running the optimization script from step 5 is shown below:

.. figure:: ./images/ParetoFront.svg
   :alt: Optimization Pareto Front
   :align: center
   :width: 300 

To plot trends in ``Free Variables`` from the beginning to the end of the optimization, copy and paste the code provided below to ``plot_script.py``. 
The blue markers provide the value of the ``Free Variable`` corresponding to a design and the red lines indicate the bounds corresponding to 
each free variable. The bounds should be set such that they are not run into during optimization if possible. 

.. code-block:: python

    fitness, free_vars = dh.get_archive_data()
    var_label = [
                '$\delta_e$ [m]', 
                "$r_ro$ [m]",
                r'$\alpha_{st}$ [deg]', 
                '$d_{so}$ [m]',
                '$w_{st}$ [m]',
                '$d_{st}$ [m]',
                '$d_{sy}$ [m]',
                r'$\alpha_m$ [deg]',
                '$d_m$ [m]',
                '$d_{mp}$ [m]',
                '$d_{ri}$ [m]',
                ]

    dims = (0.003, 0.012, 45, 5.5e-3, 9e-3, 17e-3, 13.5e-3, 180.0, 3e-3, 1e-3, 3e-3)
    # # bounds for pygmo optimization problem
    bounds = [
        [0.5 * dims[0], 2 * dims[0]],  # delta_e
        [0.5 * dims[1], 2 * dims[1]],  # r_ro    this will change the tip speed
        [0.2 * dims[2], 1.1 * dims[2]],  # alpha_st
        [0.2 * dims[3], 2 * dims[3]],  # d_so
        [0.2 * dims[4], 3 * dims[4]],  # w_st
        [0.5 * dims[5], 2 * dims[5]],  # d_st
        [0.5 * dims[6], 2 * dims[6]],  # d_sy
        [0.99 * dims[7], 1 * dims[7]],  # alpha_m
        [0.2 * dims[8], 2 * dims[8]],  # d_m
        [0 * dims[9], 1 * dims[9]],  # d_mp
        [0.3 * dims[10], 2 * dims[10]],  # d_ri
    ]

    da.plot_x_with_bounds(free_vars, var_label, bounds)

The plots showing trends in ``Free Variables`` from this optimization archive are shown below:

.. figure:: ./images/FreeVariables.svg
   :alt: Optimization Free Variables
   :align: center
   :width: 700 


Finally to select a candidate design, add ``dh.select_designs()`` line to ``plot_script.py``. You will need to modify the
design selection criteria in ``my_data_handler.py`` to get designs having the performance you desire. 

After determining the design you wish to analyze in further detail, use the following code to save it to a ``Pickle`` file for future reference. Code to extract relevant information from the ``Pickle`` file is also provided. A cross-section of the selected machine design from the Pareto front is also provided below. This machine has a power density of 7 kW/kg, efficiency of 97.6 \%, and a weighted ripple of just 1.2 pu. The pickle file for this design is available in the ``examples/mach_opt_examples/bspm_opt`` folder as ``proj_1207_.pkl``.

.. note:: You can validate the performance of this design by loading the ``Pickle`` file and passing the extracted design into the BSPM 
    ``Evaluator``.

.. code-block:: python

    # check designs which meet required specs
    dh.select_designs()

    # proj_1207_ selected based on performance
    proj_name = 'proj_1207_'
    # load proj_1207_ design from archive
    proj_1207_ = dh.get_design( proj_name)
    print(proj_name, "d_st =", proj_1207_.machine.d_st)

    # save proj_1207_ to pickle file
    object_filename = path + "/" + proj_name + r'.pkl'
    dh.save_object(proj_1207_, object_filename)

    # read proj_1207_ design from pickle file
    proj_read = dh.load_object(object_filename)
    print("From pickle file, d_st =", proj_read.machine.d_st)
