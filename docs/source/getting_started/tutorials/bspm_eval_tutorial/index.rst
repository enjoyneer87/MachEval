BSPM Evaluation Tutorial
===========================================

* **Goal:** Leverage capabilites of ``mach_eval`` to perform multi-physics evaluations on bearingless surface permanent magnet machines
* **Complexity:** 4/5
* **Estimated Time:** 30 - 60 min

This tutorial demonstrates how to perform a multi-physics evaluation of a ``BSPM_Machine`` by using the ``Analyzers`` available in ``eMach``.
By the end of this tutorial you will be able to:

* create a digital BSPM design
* use ``mach_eval`` analyzers together to perform multi-physics evaluations of BSPMs


Requirements 
---------------------

#. Python packages installed on system per :doc:`Pre-requisites <../../pre_reqs>`
#. Installation of JMAG v19 or above
#. Personal repo using ``eMach`` as submodule established (see :doc:`Rectangle Tutorial <../rectangle_tutorial/index>`)
#. (Recommended but not required) Review of mechanical and electromagnetic analyzers provided in ``mach_eval``


Step 1: Create a BSPM Design
----------------------------------------------------------------------

In the root folder of your repository, create a Python file named ``ecce_2020_bspm.py``. The code required to create an example BSPM design will
reside within this file. You can create this file by simply copying the ``ecce_2020_bspm.py`` file residing within 
``examples/mach_eval_examples/bspm_eval`` and updating the import statements as shown below.

.. code-block:: python

    import os
    import sys
    from eMach.mach_eval.machines.materials.electric_steels import Arnon5
    from eMach.mach_eval.machines.materials.jmag_library_magnets import N40H
    from eMach.mach_eval.machines.materials.miscellaneous_materials import (
        CarbonFiber,
        Steel,
        Copper,
        Hub,
        Air,
    )
    from eMach.mach_eval.machines.bspm import BSPM_Machine
    from eMach.mach_eval.machines.bspm.bspm_oper_pt import BSPM_Machine_Oper_Pt

Step 2: Create BSPM Evaluator
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The main purpose of this tutorial is to showcase how multi-physics evaluations are handled by ``eMach`` using the analyzers
provided within the repository. To demonstrate this, the structural, electromagnetic, and thermal performance of the example BSPM design created 
in ``ecce_2020_bspm.py`` are evaluated. ``AnalysisStep`` objects are created for each analyzer to ensure proper interface to and from the 
analyzers. The ``AnalysisSteps`` are then joined together to create an ``Evaluator``, in a manner so as to 
ensure proper transfer of information and to facilitate computational efficiency during optimization. In this particular example, the thermal
analyzers come after the electromagnetic analyzers as thermal performance is determined by motor losses. The structural analyzer is placed 
at the very beginning as this is a quick equation-based analyzer which determines whether an appropriate sized sleeve can be placed on an 
SPM rotor or not. Machines which are structurally unsound can be discarded prior to the computationally intensive electromagnetic 
``AnalysisStep``, thereby saving time. The steps involved in created a multi-physics BSPM ``Evaluator`` are discussed below. Readers can 
create a single Python script holding all the code snippets provided below or can separate them out into individual modules as done in  
``examples/mach_eval_examples/bspm_eval``.

Step 2.1: Create Structual ``AnalysisStep``
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In this step, we define the interface between a BSPM design and the SPM rotor retaining :doc:`sleeve analyzer <../../../mechanical_analyzers/SPM_sleeve_analyzer>`. 
The purpose of this analyzer is to determine if a retaining sleeve of sufficient strength can be applied on the SPM rotor to hold the magnets
in place at rated speed. The code snip provided below shows how this analyzer can be interfaced to a BSPM design. After the analysis is 
completed, the design is either discarded if the analyzer was unable to find an appropriately sized sleeve, or a clone of the ``BSPM_Machine`` 
is created having the sleeve size required for magnet retention.

.. note:: If you get stuck at any point of the tutorial, the ``examples/mach_eval_examples/bspm_eval folder`` provides a working example of 
    creating and evaluating the BSPM design discussed in this tutorial.


Step 2.2: Create Electromagnetic ``AnalysisStep``
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In this step, we define the interface between a BSPM design and the :doc:`BSPM JMAG 2D FEA Analyzer <../../../EM_analyzers/bspm_jmag2d_analyzer>`. 
The purpose of this analyzer is to run a JMAG 2D FEA simulation of an input BSPM machine and return data relevant to the performance of
this machine. The input provided to this analyzer is the BSPM machine and its operating point. The analyzer returns a set of dataframes
extracted from JMAG 2D FEA solve which can be interpreted to determine the motor losses and torque and force performance. As interpreting this
information can be challenging, readers are advised to copy the ``bpsm_em_post_analyzer.py`` script file in ``examples/mach_eval_examples/bspm_eval`` 
to post-process FEA results. Simply modify the import statements as shown below.

.. code-block:: python

    import copy
    import numpy as np

    from mach_eval.analyzers.force_vector_data import (
        ProcessForceDataProblem,
        ProcessForceDataAnalyzer,
    )
    from mach_eval.analyzers.torque_data import (
        ProcessTorqueDataProblem,
        ProcessTorqueDataAnalyzer,
    )

The code snip provided below shows how this analyzer can be interfaced to a BSPM design. After the analysis is completed, relevant information 
is stored in ``State`` for future reference. It is worth noting that the losses obtained from this analysis are required by the next two thermal 
``AnalysisSteps`` to determine the rotor and stator temperatures.

Step 2.3: Create Rotor Thermal ``AnalysisStep``
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In this step, we define the interface between a BSPM design and the :doc:`SPM Airflow Analyzer <../../../mechanical_analyzers/SPM_rotor_airflow_analyzer>`. 
The purpose of this analyzer is evaluate the airflow required (under certain bounds) to prevent the BSPM machine magnets from overheating at 
the provided operating conditions. The code snip provided below shows how this analyzer can be interfaced to a BSPM design and the loss data
obtained from FEA. After the analysis is completed, the design is discarded if the magnets get overheated. If the magnets are not at risk of
de-magnetization from high temperatures, the required airflow and the corresponding magnet temperature rises are saved for future reference.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In this step, we define the interface between a BSPM design and the :doc:`Stator Thermal Analyzer <../../../mechanical_analyzers/inner_rotor_stator_thermal_analyzer>`. 
The purpose of this analyzer is evaluate the stator winding temperature for a provided stator outer bore convection coefficient. 
The cooling rate is set at ``h = 200 W/m^2K`` for this evaluation. The code snip provided below shows how this analyzer can be interfaced to 
a BSPM design and the loss data obtained from FEA. After the analysis is completed, the stator winding and yoke temperatures are saved for 
future reference if the coil temperature is under 300 degC.

Step 3: Evaluate BSPM Design
--------------------------------------------------------------------
	
To evaluate the BSPM machine created in Step 1 at the defined operating point, we need to instantiate a ``MachineDesign`` object and pass it 
as an argument to the ``evaluate`` method of the ``bspm_evaluator`` created in the preceding step. The code below is provided in a manner 
such that the BSPM design is evaluated only when users try to run the ``bspm_evaluator.py`` file.

.. code-block:: python
	
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        from ecce_2020_bspm import ecce_2020_machine, ecce_2020_op_pt
        from mach_eval import MachineDesign

        ecce_2020_design = MachineDesign(ecce_2020_machine, ecce_2020_op_pt)
        results = bspm_evaluator.evaluate(ecce_2020_design)

Upon running this script you should get the following results:

- Suitable sleeve found! Thickness =  0.00093  m
- Torque =  0.33  Nm 
- Torque Density = 70260.15 Nm/m3
- Power = 5519.5 W
- Force = 0.63 N
- Force per rotor wieght = 1.81 pu 
- Force error angle = 1.06 deg 
- Magnet temperature = 54.7 degC
- Coil temperature = 169.5 degC
- Stator temperature = 161.5 degC
- Efficiency = 97.2\%

.. note:: The ``examples/mach_eval_examples/bspm_eval`` folder provides working code for the tutorial discussed here. You can run the 
    ``bspm_evaluator.py`` script here to evaluate the ``ecce_2020_design`` and compare the results against those obtained from your own 
    ``Evaluator``.

Conclusion
----------------

Congratulations! You have successfully used ``eMach`` to create a digital BSPM design and a multi-physics BSPM evaluator as well! You can now
attempt evaluating other BSPM designs using this evaluator and see what results you end up with.
